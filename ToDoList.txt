NOTE: We have to meet specific requirements for this project so make sure you meet them 
and also dont forget to COMMENT OUT CODE.

THE REQUIREMENTS:
Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript - Your website should at least:
• Include a page for capturing customer details for an order which can be validated – e.g. Name fields not left
blank, email address includes ‘@’ and a ‘.’.

• Allow the customer to enter their login details and have login details validated.
This could be the first page of your website. Using pre coded usernames and
passwords within JavaScript is fine for this.

• Include an interface for displaying products or services to purchase.

• Allow the user to “purchase” items from the site – e.g. a basket with a summary of their order, and a total price

• Allow the user to enter a coupon code and get a discount if the coupon code is valid.
For example, the coupon may be only valid before a particular date.

• Include a slideshow which displays a different image each time the page is loaded


Your site should also meet the following implementation specifications:
• Use at least 3 arrays – These arrays can be used for anything you like. For example, you could use an array for
storing the image names which could be referenced by the slideshow. Another array could be used for storing
product details.

• Use session storage for web storage in the browser – this would be useful for a basket to store products
selected by the customer to purchase and also to display a summary page with the order details.

• Be responsive to changes in browser window size. You can use bootstrap, some other framework or use your
own customised CSS rules for this.

• Access and change HTML elements on the web page through the DOM

• Access and change styling through the DOM

• Demonstrate the use of events – both inline (HTML) and DOM level 2 event listeners.
