NOTE: We have to meet specific requirements for this project so make sure you meet them 
and also dont forget to COMMENT OUT CODE.

THE REQUIREMENTS:
Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript - Your website should at least:
• Include a page for capturing customer details for an order which can be validated – e.g. Name fields not left
blank, email address includes ‘@’ and a ‘.’.

• Allow the customer to enter their login details and have login details validated.
This could be the first page of your website. Using pre coded usernames and
passwords within JavaScript is fine for this.

• Include an interface for displaying products or services to purchase.

• Allow the user to “purchase” items from the site – e.g. a basket with a summary of their order, and a total price

• Allow the user to enter a coupon code and get a discount if the coupon code is valid.
For example, the coupon may be only valid before a particular date.

• Include a slideshow which displays a different image each time the page is loaded


Your site should also meet the following implementation specifications:
• Use at least 3 arrays – These arrays can be used for anything you like. For example, you could use an array for
storing the image names which could be referenced by the slideshow. Another array could be used for storing
product details.

• Use session storage for web storage in the browser – this would be useful for a basket to store products
selected by the customer to purchase and also to display a summary page with the order details.

• Be responsive to changes in browser window size. You can use bootstrap, some other framework or use your
own customised CSS rules for this.

• Access and change HTML elements on the web page through the DOM

• Access and change styling through the DOM

• Demonstrate the use of events – both inline (HTML) and DOM level 2 event listeners.


1.Home Page
a)The title "GMIT-games" is the title to the website so we will put that on top of the webpage.
b)We will need to find a suitable font for all text that is'nt anything too fancy but makes the text look nicer.
c)Under the title we will have a bar with the following sections:
	Home
	Browse (This will be a dropdown text where u will be able to pick from 5 different genres)
	What's on sale 
	Best sellers  (We will put random 5 games into the "What's on sale" and "Best sellers" section)
	Shopping basket (basically the checkout)
d)We will need to find random 5 games for each genre of games and also decide what the genres are going to be.
e)We will need to figure out a background image for the title. (we could just go into paint and slap a couple of images of controllers or gaming stuff and we should be good)
f)For the home page we will put in all the games in a 5x10 grid (5 columns, 5 rows) and make sure they're random.
g)The basic homepage is done and we will be able to make changes once seeing the result.
MAKE SURE TO SAVE THIS AS "home.html"

2.log-in page
a)We will have 3 simple login usernames and passwords, lets use an array to store these.
	Accounts:
	user: gamer312 pass: easygames
	user: weirdturtle pass: thebigbox
	user: username pass: password (for easy access when testing, dont ask about the rest i dont have any ideas xD)
b)The title will still be there but the rest is gone.
c)We will need to put in 2 input fields for the username and password. We will have the login button and also a "forgot my password" button which takes the username you input and gives u the password for it. (yes a very hacker-proof website i know)
d)Make sure that when you input the username wrong it says "incorrect username" and the same for the password, if both are entered wrong then output "Wrong username and password". (lets make the pop-up red and not an alert box just some text on screen)

3.Genre pages
a)This will be a copy of the home page but the header will be "Browsing (genre)" and then a display of a 1x5 grid (1 row, 5 columns) with games.
b)LIST OF GENRES AND GAMES:
	Action:
	
	Adventure:
